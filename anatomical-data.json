The skinfold measurement is taken while the knee is bent.</p><p><strong>Method B:</strong> If the fold is difficult to raise the subject is asked to assist by lifting with both hands the underside of the thigh to relieve the tension of the skin.</p><p><strong>Method C:</strong> For subjects with particularly tight skinfolds, the subject is asked to assist by lifting the underside of the thigh as in (b). The recorder (standing on the medial aspect of the subject's thigh) assists by raising a fold with both hands at about 6 cm either side of the landmark.
