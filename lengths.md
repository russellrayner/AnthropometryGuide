6 Lengths
6.1 Techniques for measuring lengths

Equipment: Anthropometer with foot plate, large sliding caliper, segmometer, box

Method: There are two methods for measuring body segment lengths:

    Derived lengths: This involves first measuring projected heights which are the vertical distances from the floor to a series of marked landmarks with a full-length anthropometer. For these measurements the barefoot subject assumes the erect standing position with the feet together with arms against the sides with forearms pronated and fingers of the right hand extended. Following these measurements, the lengths of individual segments are determined by subtraction. For example, Acromiale height minus Radiale® height gives upper arm length (Acromiale-Radiale). Note that projected heights rather than segment lengths may be the variable of interest and they can be used as such.

    Direct lengths: In this method direct measurements are taken of the segment lengths from landmark to landmark. In this case either a large sliding caliper or a segmometer are the instruments used. Previous research (Day, 1986) has shown errors are more common when the projected segment lengths method is used. Therefore, it is recommended that segment lengths be measured directly. The following guidelines are based on the use of either a large sliding caliper or a segmometer. Before reading any measurement inspect each caliper branch to make sure that neither has moved away from its respective landmark. It is preferable that the caliper end where measurements are to be read is located closest to the measurer's eye level.

6.2 Measurement sites — lengths
25 Acromiale-radiale

Subject position: The subject assumes a relaxed standing position with the arms hanging by the sides. The right forearm should be pronated.
Method: This represents the arm length. It is the distance between the previously marked Acromiale® and Radiale® landmarks. One branch of the caliper or segmometer is held on the Acromiale® while the other branch is placed on the Radiale®. If the branches of the segmometer are too short to allow clearance of the Deltoids, a large sliding caliper should be used.

26 Radiale-stylion

Subject position: The subject assumes a relaxed position with the arms hanging by the sides. The right forearm should be slightly externally rotated to a mid-pronated position.
Method: This represents the length of the forearm. It is the distance between the previously marked Radiale® and Stylion landmarks. One caliper (or segmometer) branch is held against the Radiale® and the other branch is placed on the Stylion landmark.

27 Midstylion-dactylion

Subject position: The subject assumes a relaxed standing position with the left arm hanging by the side. The right elbow is partially flexed, forearm supinated, and the fingers extended (but not hyperextended).
Method: This represents the length of the hand. The measurement is taken as the shortest distance from the marked Midstylion line to the Dactylion. One branch of the caliper or segmometer is placed on the marked Midstylion line while the other branch is positioned on the Dactylion (most distal point of the third digit).

28 Iliospinale height

Subject position: The subject assumes a standing position with the feet together and the arms hanging by the sides.
Method: The height from the top of the box or the floor to the Iliospinale® is measured. If a box is used, the subject stands with feet together facing the box so that the toes are placed in the cut-out portion of the box. The base of the anthropometer or fixed branch of the segmometer is placed on the floor or on top of the box. The anthropometer or segmometer is oriented vertically with the moving branch positioned at the marked iliospinale® site. (Note: The height of interest is the height from the floor to the Iliospinale® landmark, and this should be entered onto the proforma. If a box is used, the height of interest is obtained by adding the box height to the height from the top of the box to the Iliospinale®.)

29 Trochanterion height

Subject position: The subject assumes a standing position with the feet together and the arms hanging by the sides.
Method: The height from the top of the box to the Trochanterion is measured. If a box is used, the subject stands with feet together and the lateral aspect of their right leg against the box. The base of the anthropometer or fixed branch of the segmometer is placed on top of the box. The anthropometer or segmometer is oriented vertically with the moving branch positioned at the marked Trochanterion site. (Note: The height of interest is the height from the floor to the Trochanterion landmark, and this should be entered onto the proforma. If a box is used, the height of interest is obtained by adding the box height to the height from the top of the box to the Trochanterion.)

30 Trochanterion-tibiale laterale

Subject position: The subject assumes a standing position with the feet together and the arms folded across the thorax.
Method: This represents the length of the thigh. The distance between the marked Trochanterion and Tibiale laterale landmarks is measured. One branch of the anthropometer or segmometer is placed on the marked Trochanterion and the other branch is placed on the marked Tibiale laterale site.

31 Tibiale laterale height

Subject position: The subject assumes a standing position with the feet together and the arms hanging by the sides.
Method: This represents the length of the leg. It is usual practice to have the subject stand on the box while the base of the anthropometer or fixed branch of the segmometer is on the top of the box and the moving branch is placed on the marked Tibiale laterale site. The anthropometer or segmometer should be held in the vertical plane. A spirit level may be used to verify this. The height from the Tibiale laterale to the top of the box is then measured.

32 Foot length

Subject position: The subject assumes a relaxed standing position with the feet comfortably apart and weight evenly distributed. The arms are hanging by the sides.
Method: This is the distance from the Akropodion (the tip of the longest toe — which may be the first or second phalanx) to the Pternion (most posterior point on the calcaneus of the foot). Minimal pressure is applied to the large sliding caliper. It is more convenient for the measurer if the subject stands on the box during this measurement.

33 Tibiale mediale-sphyrion tibiale

Subject position: The subject is seated with the right ankle resting over the left knee so that the medial aspect of the leg is able to be measured.
Method: This represents the length of the tibia. It is the measured length between the Tibiale mediale and the Sphyrion tibiale. One branch of the anthropometer or segmometer is placed on the marked Tibiale mediale site and the other branch is positioned on the marked Sphyrion site.
